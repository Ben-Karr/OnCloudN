# On Cloud N: Cloud Cover Detection Challenge 
This Challenge was hosted on [DrivenData](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/83/cloud-cover/) and the goal is to segment clouds in Sentenial-2 Satelite data. Besides visual image data, the Sentenial-2 dataset also offers different non-visual bands, in particular infrared. This solution uses geometric augmentations on all four channels and "visual" augmentations on the rgb-channels only. The model is a simple U-Net that is pretrained on 440x440 random crops and fine tuned on the whole image in the original chip resolution (512x512). The submission ensembles 3 models with different splits where two are fp32, the other is fp16 and places at position 50 (Top 6%).
