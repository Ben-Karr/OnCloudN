# On Cloud N: Cloud Cover Detection Challenge 
This Challenge was hosted on [DrivenData](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/83/cloud-cover/) and the goal is to segment clouds in Sentinel-2 Satelite data. Besides visual image data, the Sentinel-2 dataset also offers different non-visual bands, in particular infrared. This solution uses geometric augmentations on all four channels and "visual" augmentations on the rgb-channels only. The model is a simple U-Net that is pretrained on 440x440 random crops and fine tuned on the whole image in the original chip resolution (512x512). The submission ensembles 3 models with different splits where two are fp32, the other is fp16 and places at position 50 (Top 6%). The dataset has a lot of issues with its label masks (broken, wrong, inconsistent) to improve training a lot of these instances are removed.

## Notebooks
* __[fastai-OnCloudN-Train](https://github.com/Ben-Karr/OnCloudN/blob/master/%5Bfastai%5D-OnCloudN-Train.ipynb)__ _(Pre-)Trains the model with a U-Net using a resnet34 backbone_
* __[Inference/Test Predictions](https://github.com/Ben-Karr/OnCloudN/blob/master/Inference/Test%20Predictions.ipynb)__ _Predicts segmentations masks with multiple models and ensembles & post processes the results._
* __[Check image metadata](https://github.com/Ben-Karr/OnCloudN/blob/master/Check%20image%20metadata.ipynb)__ _Gets different metadata for the dataset, in particular the mean and standard deviation, that can be used to improve the training._
* __[Remove bad Data from Dataset](https://github.com/Ben-Karr/OnCloudN/blob/master/Remove%20bad%20Data%20from%20Dataset.ipynb)__ _Take a look at all images and masks and sort out those which have some kind of problem._
* __[Find mixed up masks](https://github.com/Ben-Karr/OnCloudN/blob/master/Find%20mixed%20up%20masks.ipynb)__ _Try to fix some of the broken masks._
